This section contains ellipse drawing routines designed for pairwise
confidence intervals, including distorted ellipses for nonlinear
regression intervals.  It also includes a fix for profile.ms that
is needed by pairs.profile.ms, which is installed in the temporary
database 0 by .First.lib, and a routine "plotcorr" for plotting correlation
matrices using ellipses.
