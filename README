This package contains ellipse drawing routines designed for pairwise
confidence regions, including distorted ellipses for nonlinear
regression regions.  It also includes a routine "plotcorr" for 
plotting correlation matrices using ellipses.

The examples require the MASS, nls and ts packages.
