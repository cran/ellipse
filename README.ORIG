This package (ellipse.shar 1.1) contains various routines for drawing
ellipses and ellipse-like confidence regions.  There are three groups of
routines:

plotcorr - This routine implements the plots described in Murdoch and
Chow (1994), "A Graphical Display of Large Correlation Matrices",
Queen's University Mathematical Preprint #1994-09.  These display
correlations using ellipses, whose shape is that of the contours of a
bivariate normal distribution with matching correlation.

pairs.profile - This routine implements a version of the profile plots
described in Bates and Watts (1988), Nonlinear Regression Analysis and its
Applications.

ellipse* - These routines provide the basis for the others, drawing
ellipses based on various S objects, including scalar correlations,
covariance matrices, arima.mle, lm, and nls fits.

Files included:

  README.1ST  - this file
  README      - short description for S-PLUS library
  INSTALL     - installation instructions
  ellipse.s   - source code for the routines and for the help files.

This library has been tested in S-PLUS 3.2 on a Sun, and S-PLUS 3.1 for
Windows.  It is self-contained for a Sun installation, but installation
in S-PLUS for Windows will require translation of the help files using
the DETROFF program, also available from statlib.

This library was written by D. J. Murdoch and E. D. Chow.  It may be
used for non-commercial purposes at no charge.  

If you have any questions about it, or would like to report bugs, please
send email to Duncan Murdoch at dmurdoch@mast.queensu.ca.

History:

1.0  - first release
1.1  - fixed rounding bug in plotcorr, MS Windows incompatibility in
       .First.lib
